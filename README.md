With more time I would tidy up the code more, it can possibly be simplified and shortened, I would try to reuse more logic and separate more of the functionalities. I would also change some of the variable names because it can get somewhat confusing with many similar sounding names

TypeScript - I would clear out any warnings / problems and clarify all the necessary interfaces and types, add proper keys where relevant

Breakpoints - would make sure the application displays properly for all screen sizes

Testing - Would write more integration and unit tests, as well as make them cover many more scenarios including negative or non-numeric values, large numbers

Bonus task, I would create a custom hook useFetch and I would also add functionality that prevents incorrect data to be entered, and better error display and red borders underneath the relevant input fields that shows what exactly went wrong
